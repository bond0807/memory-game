## Instructions

The objective of Memory Match Up is to match all of the turned down cards in the shortest time and fewest number of moves possible.

To get started, click any card.
Select a second card.  If the cards match, animation will occur and the color of the matching cards will go from blue to yellow.
Continue until all cards on the board are matched.
As the move number increases, the star count will begin to decrease until it reaches one star.  With one star being the lowest possible score.
Once all cards are matched, a popup will appear with your total time and number of moves.
